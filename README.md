# ADC-Project
Objective: 
Implement a MATLAB code that takes an arbitrary number of signals as an input (M signals) 
and uses Gram-Schmidt procedure to produce the minimum number of required orthonormal 
basis functions (N bases function) to represent the M signals. Use constellation diagram to 
calculate the probability of errors in the system practically. 
Required: 
Part1 
Implement a MATLAB code to ask the user to enter M signals matrix as its input then 
produce the N basis functions for these signals then performing the following functions:  
1. Plot the M input signals, and the N basis functions. 
2. Plot the constellation diagram of the signals. 
3. Calculate the energy of each symbols using the constellation diagram. 
4. Test your code using the two following sets of signals and document the results. 
i.e: The code should be generic to be used with any M signals
